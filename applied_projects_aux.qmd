## 2025 INFORMS Analytics+ Conference

*I mentored 2 student projects through the Krenicki Center for Business Analytics & Machine Learning at Purdue University the that were presented as Posters in the [2025 INFORMS Analytics+ Conference](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/analytics/){target="_blank"}. Both teams combine undergraduate and graduate students from Purdue University. To check these projects details, check the next section.*

This initiative enhances cookie sales forecasting for the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana by advancing their predictive methods beyond the current naive approach, which relies solely on prior-year data and explains about 70% of sales variability. By utilizing advanced time series forecasting techniques applied to comprehensive data from 1,000 troops collected over five years, I mentored the student to develop a more complex predictive model and incorporate critical factors such as troop participation rates, regional market dynamics, and seasonal fluctuations. This refined approach yields superior predictive accuracy exceeding 80%, significantly improving inventory management by reducing surplus and optimizing sales opportunities. The resulting analytical framework not only improves immediate decision-making and fundraising effectiveness but also provides a foundation for future organizational advancements in forecasting and resource allocation.

### Indy Reads Project

In this project, I mentored students that collaborated with **Indy Reads** to enhance the organization’s enrollment process by identifying inefficiencies and integrating current data sources. The project aimed to reduce manual data entry and create a more streamlined experience for applicants, staff, and volunteers. By reviewing the existing process—spanning Form Assembly, Salesforce, SharePoint, Calendly, and InTERS—the team ensured seamless data flow across all systems. Implementing simple automations, the students improved operational efficiency, boosted responsiveness for applicants, and significantly lowered staff workload.

Web app produced during the first *Hackathon Câmara dos Deputados* (2013). I engineered the web crawler and topic‑model pipeline that analysed **14k speeches** from over **400 deputies** (2011‑2013), surfacing **70 rhetorical themes**. A team of undergraduate students at Federal University of Pernambuco worked with me to relaunch the project in 2022.
