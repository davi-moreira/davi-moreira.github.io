**Welcome!**

I am a Clinical Assistant Professor of Management in the [Quantitative Methods Area at the Daniels School of Business, Purdue University](https://business.purdue.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/). Before this, I held several academic positions, including Visiting Assistant Professor positions at the [Quantitative Theory and Methods Department at Emory University](https://quantitative.emory.edu/index.html) and the [School of Global Policy and Strategy at UC San Diego](https://gps.ucsd.edu/). I also served as an Assistant Professor in the [Political Science Department at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) in Brazil](https://www.ufpe.br/dcp). In 2017, I was honored with the Best Brazilian Ph.D. Dissertation Prize in Political Science and International Relations.

My research and teaching interests focus on Data Science, Text as Data, NLP, and Artificial Intelligence.
