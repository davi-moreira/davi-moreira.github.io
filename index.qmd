**Welcome!**

I am currently a Clinical Assistant Professor in the [Daniels School of Business, Quantitative Methods Area at the Management Department, Purdue University](https://business.purdue.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/). Before this, I held various academic positions, including Visiting Assistant Professor at the [Quantitative Theory and Methods Department, Emory University](https://quantitative.emory.edu/index.html), Visiting Assistant Professor at the [School of Global Policy and Strategy, UC San Diego](https://gps.ucsd.edu/), and Assistant Professor in the [Political Science Department, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil](https://www.ufpe.br/dcp). I also led the [Computational and Experimental Political Science Lab (\@cpcex_lab)](https://cpcex-lab.rbind.io/en/). In 2017, I was honored with the Best Brazilian Ph.D. Dissertation Prize in Political Science and International Relations.

My research focuses on Political Methodology, Data Science, Text as Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Comparative Politics.
