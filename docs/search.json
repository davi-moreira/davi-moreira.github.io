    "text": "Turning Data Into Impact\nI’m pleased to share an inspiring story about the transformative impact of experiential learning projects I mentored at Purdue University’s Daniels School of Business this Spring Semester in 2025. This feature highlights how my students have successfully leveraged their data science and analytical skills to support nonprofit organizations, such as Indy Reads and Girl Scouts of Central Indiana. Through these collaborative projects, our students not only gained valuable real-world experience but also made meaningful contributions by improving operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities for these community-focused organizations. You can read more about this enriching collaboration and its positive outcomes here.\n\n\nTransforming Nonprofits, Empowering Students\nThis piece shares a feature from Purdue University’s Daniels School of Business that highlights the impactful collaboration between our students and nonprofit organizations through the Krenicki Center for Business Analytics and Machine Learning’s Community Impact Initiative during the 2025 Spring Semester. This initiative exemplifies how experiential learning can simultaneously empower students and strengthen community organizations. In this article, you’ll find insights into how student teams mentored by me applied data analytics to address real-world challenges faced by nonprofits, enhancing their operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. As a faculty mentor, I had the privilege of guiding these students as they developed practical solutions that not only enriched their educational experience but also delivered tangible benefits to our community partners. You can read more about this collaborative effort here.\n\n\nCiências Sociais Computacionais: texto como dado\nNa última semana (21 de junho de 2022) tive a oportunidade de apresentar seminário sobre Ciências Sociais Computacionais e tratar especialmente da abordagem do Texto como Dado para o PPGCP/UFPA. A apresentação está publicada no YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gfXaBu6LHE\n\n\nTeoria da conspiração e agenda internacional\nEm 29 de janeiro de 2021 foi publicada no jornal Valor Econômico matéria sobre pesquisa com a qual contribuo: https://valor.globo.com/eu-e/noticia/2021/01/29/como-as-teorias-da-conspiracao-guiam-a-agenda-internacional-de-bolsonaro.ghtml\n\n\nX Seminário de Observatórios: ciência aberta, transparência e democracia em contexto de crises\nNo dia 27 de outubro de 2020 participei da décima edição do Seminário de Observatórios promovido pelo Instituto Humanitas Unisinus (IHU). Nessa edição, estive na mesa Experiências: Políticas de dados abertos junto com a pesquisadora Marília Gehrke (UFRGS). Nossas falas e o debate podem ser encontrados nesse link do YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26UnZeRix-w&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nPODMÉTODOS | Populismo: conceito, mensuração e implicações em políticas públicas\nEm 11 de junho de 2020, eu e meu colega Umberto Mignozzetti falamos sobre “Populismo: conceito, mensuração e implicações em políticas públicas” no episódio 07 do PODMÉTODOS. É possível ouvir o episódio no canal disponível no Spotify!\n\n\nWebinar | Populismo em tempos de pandemia\nEm 29 de abril de 2020, eu e meu colega Umberto Mignozzetti falamos sobre “Populismo em tempos de pandemia”. O webinar pode ser visto no canal da FGV no YouTube!\n\n\nTecnologias, dados e políticas públicas: desafios no cenário contemporâneo\nNo dia 30 de outubro de 2019 tive a oportunidade de fazer a conferência de abertura do IX Seminário de Observatórios, realizado pelo Instituto Humanitas Unisinos (IHU) na Unisinos em Porto Alegre-RS. O vídeo está aqui para quem quiser conferir!\nNa mesma oportunidade também participei do painel Observatórios, Tecnologia e Democracia: desafios contemporâneos junto com a Pesquisadora Anne Clinio (Fiocruz).\n\n\nNunca é tarde…\nNão fui muito produtivo na iniciativa do blog, mas no ano de 2017 pude publicar sobre um pouco do que estive desenvolvendo nos projetos do Banco Mundial em Moçambique, segue link:\nhttps://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/improving-how-we-measure-progress-community-biodiversity-conservation-projects-mozambique\n\n\nIniciando os trabalhos\nFaz tempo que desejo começar um blog. Como todos que trabalham com estatística e programação, por vezes fui beneficiado pelo trabalho de desconhecidos que publicaram seus códigos e suas ideias na rede. É este o principal objetivo deste espaço.\nPara ser produtivo, desde já indico que não serei purista nas minhas publicações. Não vou ficar revisando meu código ou meu texto para publicar. Assim que tiver algo que possa ser útil para alguém, vou fazer questão de publicá-lo, mesmo sem a devida revisão e rigor que esta atividade pode merecer. Peço desculpas por isso, mas para contribuir ao máximo com as ideias e o conteúdo da rede, vou adotar a estratégia de que o ótimo é inimigo do bom! Me perdoem pelos possíveis erros que possa cometer.\nTudo o que for publicado pode ser utilizado de forma livre e gratuita. Peço a gentileza de citarem a fonte quando puderem e estarei aberto a quaisquer comentários. Na medida do possível – hoje faço doutorado e trabalho no mínimo 40 horas semanais -, vou me esforçar para responder a todas as indagações. No entanto, é importante deixar claro que este será mais um espaço de publicação do que de debate.\nDe forma secundária, este blog será feito para mim mesmo. Desejo manter o registro de coisas que considero importantes para a minha vida e minha atividade profissional.\nA princípio as publicações estarão em português, mas pode ser que eventualmente eu faça alguma coisa na língua inglesa. Recomendo a todos os seres deste planeta que aprendam essa língua como meio para maximizar sua existência. O inglês não só se tornou a língua da Ciência contemporânea, como compõe a maior parte do conteúdo publicado na internet.\nÉ isso aí, vamos colocar a mão na massa!"

By utilizing advanced time series forecasting techniques applied to comprehensive data from 1,000 troops collected over five years, I mentored the student to develop a more complex predictive model and incorporate critical factors such as troop participation rates, regional market dynamics, and seasonal fluctuations. This refined approach yields superior predictive accuracy exceeding 80%, significantly improving inventory management by reducing surplus and optimizing sales opportunities. The resulting analytical framework not only improves immediate decision-making and fundraising effectiveness but also provides a foundation for future organizational advancements in forecasting and resource allocation.\n\n\nIndy Reads Project\n\n\n\nProject team: Rohan Ajay, Parth Kapila and Harsh Srivastava.\n\n\nIn this project, I mentored students that collaborated with Indy Reads to enhance the organization’s enrollment process by identifying inefficiencies and integrating current data sources. The project aimed to reduce manual data entry and create a more streamlined experience for applicants, staff, and volunteers. By reviewing the existing process—spanning Form Assembly, Salesforce, SharePoint, Calendly, and InTERS—the team ensured seamless data flow across all systems. Implementing simple automations, the students improved operational efficiency, boosted responsiveness for applicants, and significantly lowered staff workload."
